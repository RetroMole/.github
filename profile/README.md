# RetroMole.
## Open-source Retro Game Level Editor for Various 8/16-bit Consoles
The primary goal of RetroMole is to allow anyone to romhack and customize various old school games such as the NES/SNES/GB(A) main-line Super Mario games with full freedom over the exact details of what is going into the ROM while keeping it accessible to newer users.

Giving users the freedom to experiment with changing any part of these games as they wish while making it easy to do so is an enormous task, therefore, in order to cater to both new users and experienced romhackers alike, we've decided that the primary core code repository will only hold the underlying systems necesarry for users to build their own romhacking experience using both [official and community-made packages](https://github.com/orgs/RetroMole/packages) to introduce various tooling and tweak it endlessly to the users exact preferences, while allowing developers to create, distribute, and update, these packages easily, trough the use of competent generic interfaces in the core repository, and a well-managed custom packaging system.
