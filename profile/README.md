# RetroMole.
## Open-source Retro Game Level Editor for Various 8/16-bit Consoles
The primary goal of RetroMole is to allow anyone to romhack and customize various old school games such as the NES/SNES/GB(A) main-line Super Mario games with full freedom over the exact details of what is going into the ROM while keeping it accessible to newer users.

Giving users the freedom to experiment with changing any part of these games as they wish while making it easy to do so is an enormous task, therefore, in order to cater to both new users and experienced romhackers alike, we've decided that the primary core code repository will only hold the underlying systems necesarry for users to build their own romhacking experience using both [official and community-made packages](https://github.com/orgs/RetroMole/packages) to introduce various tooling and tweak it endlessly to the users exact preferences, while allowing developers to create, distribute, and update, these packages easily, trough the use of competent generic interfaces in the core repository, and a well-managed custom packaging system.

## Currently On hiatus
Currently the lead developer of RetroMole, Hazel (@Vawlpe) is busy trying to figure things out IRL, the [`main` branch of the core repo](https://github.com/RetroMole/MOLE/tree/main) will remain practically empty untill full-throttle development resumes, in the meantime, here's what you can explore:

- ### Slow Development Branch:
  [An up-to-date experimental branch](https://github.com/RetroMole/MOLE/tree/dev) exists which holds current code as we work on it in our free time despite the hiatus.

- ### Wiki:
  [Our Wiki](https://github.com/RetroMole/MOLE/wiki) holds various documentation on existing systems and how to set things up for both new users, experienced romhackers, developers, and just anyone who fancies reading up on things.

- ### Discussions:
  Discuss or read up on various planned features, bugs, concepts, tooling, announcements, showcases, Q&As, etc... on [our discussions page](https://github.com/orgs/RetroMole/discussions).

- ### Archives:
  There is currently 3 branches on the core repo that begin with the prefix `Old-` followed by a `YYYY/MM/DD` date corresponding to the last code-related change made on that branch, these are previous failed attempts at bringing RetroMole to life, although the even older attempts before the switch to C# are sadly missing
